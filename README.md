# **What I Learned Week 7**
## **Day 25**   
Finished going over hw

Started learning new way to write functions making them variables with const.   

An example would look like:   

const nameOfFunction = function(x,y)  
{ return x+ y}

For of loops 

Discussed midterm a bit.

## **Day 26**  

Took midterm and then went over each problem on Midterm.



## **Day 27**   

CallBacks:  

const callback function = function(callback){
}
  

searchBar.addeventlistener(‘click’,function)



  
  ## **Day 28**   

  Starting using callback functions for DOM manipulation:
  
  const lis = document.querySelectorAll('li')  
  

const makeBlue = function(event)   
{
  event.target.style.color = 'blue';
}

for (const li of lis) {  
li.addEventListener('click', makeBlue)  
}  
Did a collaboration assignment with DOM manipulation and went over it. 



**keyboard shortcuts to remember**
